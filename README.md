# STS
Raw data from calibration of the STS modules, analysis of the STS data and automation of analysis-related tasks and activities for the STS.
# How to use
In order to analyze data for one module (example data included), run the following command:
```
$ ./analyze_pscan.sh M4DL0B1001611B2/
```
# Description
## Bash scripts
## Python scripts
## Module files
### p-scan files
### trim files
### connectivity check files
## Analysis macros

# Future development ideas
* rewrite from scratch
  + python serial communication scripts 
  + ROOT analysis macros
* divide the codebase using OOP principles
* synchronize data taking and analysis to plot results dynamically
